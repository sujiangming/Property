    	Define your models in the list with mapping tag, LitePal will
    	create tables for each mapping class. The supported fields
    	defined in models will be mapped into columns.
    	For example:
    	<list>
    		<mapping class="com.test.model.Reader" />
    		<mapping class="com.test.model.Magazine" />
    	</list>
    -->
    <list>
        <mapping class="com.jdry.property.bean.LoginBeanBackup" />
        <mapping class="com.jdry.property.bean.LoginDataBeanBackup" />
        <mapping class="com.jdry.property.bean.LoginDataAuthBeanBackup" />
    </list>
    <!--
        Define where the .db file should be. "internal" means the .db file
        will be stored in the database folder of internal storage which no
        one can access. "external" means the .db file will be stored in the
        path to the directory on the primary external storage device where
        the application can place persistent files it owns which everyone
        can access. "internal" will act as default.
        For example:
        <storage value="external" />
